Got it! Here are **ALL** the steps after confirming the extension works:

## Complete Steps After Testing:

### Step 1: Install the packaging tool
```bash
npm i -g @vscode/vsce
```

### Step 2: Package the extension into a .vsix file
```bash
vsce package
```
This creates `copy-file-tree-0.0.1.vsix`

### Step 3: Install the .vsix in your regular Cursor

**Option A - GUI Method:**
1. In your regular Cursor (not the Extension Development Host)
2. Press `âŒ˜/Ctrl + Shift + P`
3. Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
4. Select the `copy-file-tree-0.0.1.vsix` file
5. Click "Reload" when prompted

**Option B - CLI Method:**
```bash
cursor --install-extension copy-file-tree-0.0.1.vsix
```

### Step 4: Restart Cursor
- Close all Cursor windows
- Reopen Cursor

### Step 5: Use it everywhere!
- Open any project in Cursor
- Right-click files/folders in Explorer
- "Copy file tree to clipboard" is now permanently available
- Paste anywhere to get the formatted Markdown tree + file contents

That's it! The extension will now work in all your Cursor sessions, not just the development host.`
